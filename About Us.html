                <h1>About God Is Able agencies</h1>
                <p>God Is Able Agency is an evangelist group that is founded and rooted on the word of God. The group started from Kenyatta University officially on 9/2/2019 and has spread to many other campuses and colleges. It was started as the group of three people but has grown to hundreds of members. G.I.A is neither church nor group based on specific religious doctrine but a bible based body. It consists of members from all denominations including catholic and Seventh Day Adventist Churches. The group does not change people’s denominations or change their religion but empower people to know bible truth (Spiritual truth) through reading, teaching and practicing the word. G.I.A is a family of disciples of Christ. We focus on building up disciples rather than increasing the number. The members are committed to reading the word daily, fasting at least three days a month, visiting orphans at least twice a year. Members of the group are able to minister in relation to area of their call. What is very evident in the group is that all members are filled with the holy spirit including the Catholics and SDA evidenced through speaking in other tongues. The group contain various tribes in Kenya and two members from Tanzania.</p>

                <h1>Pillars of G.I.A</h1>
                <ol class="sub-menu">
                    <li>Love</li>
                    <p>God Is Able Agency upholds love as one of the most important virtue of all. We love God with all our hearts, all our souls and with all our minds, we love our neighbors as we love ourselves (Mark12:28-34). We are inspired by the words of John, "Dear friends let us love one another, for love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God(1john4:7)." Paul says love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud…… (1Cor13:4-8). God Is Able Agency want to be and known as a family of love.</p>
                    <li>Righteousness</li>
                    <p>God command us to live holy and righteous life shunning away from all evil by all means. Abraham, Job, Joseph and Mary attained this state of righteousness meaning that even us in this age we can still attain it. Righteousness is the state attained by living according to God’s word and following his voice and will in Christ Jesus in every aspect of our life. This can only be achieved by the grace of God on our life (Spirit of God). The one who has called us is holy so want us to be holy(1Pet1:15-16).</p>
                    <li>Commitment and sacrifice</li>
                    <p>The success of this family depends on the commitment and sacrifice of members towards the G.I.A vision, mission and objectives. Members sacrifices fare to the mission ground and additional costs for orphans and street children home visit. Every disciple takes the initiative to spread the gospel of God to less reached places, because if we don’t then none can do it. The members sacrifice time in prayer, fasting and reading the word of God because they want to walk in the power of Christ every place they go and to bring revival. We study the word with great eagerness and examine scriptures daily to know its truth, exercise it and operate in it without limit and exception. (Acts17:11).</p>
                    <li>Word of God without exception</li>
                    <p>Every practice of the group is bible based. Nothing is done outside the word of God. The holy bible is the root and foundation of every activity done in the group. Jesus Christ is the cornerstone that we preach and is our role model. We practice everything he was teaching and doing while on earth.</p>
                    <li>Service and submission</li>
                    <p>Every member in the group is a servant and serve the lord Jesus at their own operational levels of grace upon them. We believe that all are called to serve in the vineyard of God and not just specific people. We are also committed to submission to the will of God and to serve in every area of call. Submission is all about service. The bible says that whoever wants to be greater must serve others to the will of God. The bible also says whoever wants to be great must serve just like the son of man come not to be served but to serve (Math20:26-28).</p>

                <h1>Believe of God Is Able Agency</h1>
                <ol>
                    <li>We believe in one God who reveals himself in three dimension, Father, Son and Holy Spirit as the creator of heaven and earth (Mat28:19).</li>
                    <li>We believe in the lord Jesus Christ, the only begotten son of God, who was conceived of the holy spirit, born of the virgin Mary, crucified, died buried, resurrected and ascended to heaven and now is sited at the right hand of his father and God (Acts 2:23-24,32).</li>
                    <li>We believe in the power of God through his word, manifestation (1cor4:20, 1The1:5, 1Cor2:4-5) We believe in double healing, miracles, signs and wonders through faith in the name of Jesus Christ (Mark16:17-20).</li>
                    <li>We believe in double baptism, that is that of water (John1:26, Acts11:16, Acts19:3-6) and the Holy Spirit evidenced through speaking in tongues as the spirit give utterance (Act2:4, 1Cor12:10, Act10:45-46).</li>
                    <li>We believe fully in the teaching of Jesus Christ and all the demonstration of the power of God through him, his and our Father. We believe in the supernatural operation and intervention of God. We also believe nothing is impossible in his glorious name.</li>
                    <li>We believe in the resurrection of the dead both the righteous and unrighteous. The eternal blessing to the redeemed and the eternal torment of those who rejected, blasphemed Christ Jesus and Holy Spirit and walked in flesh conforming to the deeds and standards of this word.</li>
                    <li>We believe in the second coming of Jesus Christ.</li>
                    <li>We believe that all that repents of their sin and confess the son of God, Jesus Christ with their mouth and believe in their hearts that he come in flesh, died and was risen by the power of God are born again and therefore become children of God.</li>
                    <li>We believe in sanctification through the word of God, blood of Jesus and the holy Spirit and in personal righteousness, purity of heart and life.</li>
                    <li>We believe that Jesus was for all who believe in him and not religious hence we don’t limit a specific person joining us on grounds of their denomination.</li>
                    <li>We also believe in submitting to authority, and the group is not above the law of the state in anyway and those who went before us in relation to the word of God.</li>
                    <li>We believe that Jesus Christ commissioned each of us to spread his word with the mandate to empty hell and fill heaven and all denominations of Christ Jesus are called to this call hence multi-denominational.</li>
